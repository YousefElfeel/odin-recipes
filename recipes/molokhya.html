     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>
        Molokhia, also Mulukhia is a green soup made from minced Jews/Jute mallow leaves and cooked in broth.

        This is the Egyptian Molokhia with all its tips and tricks from my grandma's kitchen.
     </p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
         <li>ghee</li>
         <li>crushed garlic</li>
         <li>dry coriander</li>

         <li>tomato sauce</li>
         <li>frozen Molokhia</li>
         <li>salt to taste</li>
     </ul>
     <ol>
         <il>
            In a deep pot over medium-high heat melt ghee then sauté garlic for 15-30 seconds until lightly golden and fragrant.
         </il>
         <il>
            Add coriander and keep stirring for another 30 seconds.
         </il>
         <il>
            Pour in one and half cups broth and sprinkle the bouillon cube.
         </il>
         <il>
            <p>Stir everything together until bouillon is dissolved.</p>
            <p>Stir in the baking soda if using.</p>
         </il>
         <li>
            <p>Add the Molokhia, and turn down the heat to medium low.</p>
            <p>Using a whisk stir until the Molokhia has melted completely in the broth.</p>
         </li>
            Pour in the tomato sauce and still well.
         <il>
            <p>Check consistency of the Molokhia, It is going to be thick.</p>
            <p>If you like it that way then do not add any more broth but if you want it thinner then add broth until you reach the consistency you love.</p>
         </il>
         <il>
            <p>Now Check the taste if you need more sweetness and tartness add more tomato sauce.</p>
            <p> If it needs more salt add salt to your liking.</p>
         </il>
         <il>
            Continue cooking Molokhia until the leaves are cooked and does not taste raw anymore.
         </il>
         <il>Molokhia is usually done when it just starts boiling all over on low heat.</il>
         <il>Do not cover Molokhia immediately, let it cool down completely before covering or serve directly with rice, chicken and pita bread.</il>
