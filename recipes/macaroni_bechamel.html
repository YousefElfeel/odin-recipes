     <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Cook pasta according to package instructions and start preparing the ground beef mixture.</p>
            <p>Saute onion, then add beef, break it apart and keep cooking until no longer pink. Add spices, tomato paste and mix all well.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In another large pot melt butter, then add oil and flour.</p>
            <p>Whisk flour until it turns pale yellow.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Gradually pour in milk and stock while whisking until the mixture has no lumps.</p>
            <p>season with salt and pepper and keep cooking until it thickens.</p>
            <p>Your bechamel is ready when it fully coats the back of a spoon and when you draw a path across with your finger it doesn’t disappear.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix about ¾ of the bechamel sauce with the cooked pasta in the pasta pot.

            <p>Spread half of the cooked pasta then top with the meat mixture.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread the remaining pasta over then top with the bechamel sauce
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Level and bake in the center of your oven until top is golden brown.</p>
            <p>Let the casserole stand for 10-15 minutes before cutting and serving.</p>
